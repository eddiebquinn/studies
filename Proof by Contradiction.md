- To prove a statement by contradiction you say "assume this statement is not true" then prove something impossible would have to be true for that to be the case
## Example
> Prove the following statement: If $x^2$ is even then $x$ must be even

Assume the statement is **not** true - Then there must be an off number that squares to be even.

If $x$ is off, you can write $x$ as $2k+1$, where $k$ is an integer ([[Mathematical Definitions#Odd number|def of and odd number]]). From this you sub in to get the folowing

$$x^2=(2k+1)^2$$
$$x^2=4k^2+4k+1$$

From this you can rearrange $4k^2+4k+1$ to be $2(2k^2+2k)+1$. We also know that $2k^2+2k$ is a ineger. Given both of these statements we can rewrite it as
$$y=(2k^2+2k)$$
$$x^2=2y+1$$
$x^2=2y+1$ is the [[Mathematical Definitions#Odd number|definition of and odd number]], however this is not possible if the assumption that $x^2$ is even is true. We have contracted the assumption that there is an odd number for $x$ for which $x^2$ is even, *therefore* if $x^2$ is even then $x$ must be even prooving the original statement
