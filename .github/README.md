# Studies repo
I have made several attempts in the past to make a centralised repo of all my study notes, some remmantants still exsist on my github profile. I have decided to make another attempt. In order to allow for future flexibility I want to leave the rules openended for how i intend to handle these notes.

## Rules

### Topics
Every note needs to be tagged with a topic, so far the topics are
- Mathematics
- Computer-science
