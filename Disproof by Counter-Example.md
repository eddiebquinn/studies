- Disproof by counter-example is the easiest way to show a mathematical statement is false
- The idea is to find one case where the statement doesn't hold

## Example
> Disprove the following statement:
> "For any pair of real numbers $x$ and $y$, if $x>y$ then $x^2+x>y^2+y$"

To disprove this statement it is enough to find just one example where $x>y$ but $x^2+x\le y^2+y$

lets assume the following
$$x=2;y=-4$$
this would mean $x>y$. However when you sub in to the equity $x^2+x>y^2+y$ you find the following
$$4+2>16+4$$
$$6>20$$
With these values the first part of the statement holds, but not the second part
