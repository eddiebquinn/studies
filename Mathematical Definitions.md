This is a list of common mathemtical definitions that can be refrenced in other notes
## Worded definitions
### Rational number
a rational number is 'a number that can be written as a quotient of two intergers, where the denominator is non-zero'

## Algebraic definitions
### Even and odd numbers
*note: These can be used in [[Mathematical Proof|proofs]]* that require you to prove scnario $x$ will always output an odd/even number. An example of this can be seen [[Proof by Exhaustion#Example|here]]
#### Even number
$$x=2n$$
#### Odd number
$$x=2m+1$$
