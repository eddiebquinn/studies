- This is sometimes also called 'direct proof' or 'proof by direct argument'.
- This is where you use known facts to build up your argument and show a statement must be true
## Example
>A defintion of a rational number is 'a number that can be written as a quotient of two intergers, where the denominator is non-zero'
>Use this definition to prove that the following statement is true: "The product of two rational numbers is always a rational number"

Take any two rational numbers ($a$, $b$). By defintion you will be able to write them in the following forms:
$$a=\frac{p}{q};b=\frac{r}{s}$$
where $p$, $q$, $r$, $s$ are all intergers and $q$ and $s$ are non zero.
$$ab = \frac{pr}{qs}$$
$pr$ and $qs$ are the products of intergers meaning they are also integers, and $q$ and $s$ are both non zero so $qs$ must also be non zero

We have shown that $ab$ is a quotient of two intergers and has a non-zero denominator, so by defintiion $ab$ is rational, provving the original assertion
