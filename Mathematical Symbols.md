## Logic symbols
### $\implies$ and $\iff$
- These show one thing implies another
	- "$p \implies q$"  means "*p implies q*" or "*if p then q*" (e.g. $x=2 \implies x^2 = 4$)
	- "$p \iff q$" means "*p implies q and q implies p*" or "*p if and only if q*" (e.g. $x^2 = 4 \iff x = \pm2$)

## Equals sign variations
### Identity symbol ($\equiv$)
- This means that two things are identically equal to each other
$$(a+b)(a-b) \equiv a^2-b^2$$
